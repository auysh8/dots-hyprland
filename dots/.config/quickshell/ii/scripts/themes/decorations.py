"""Read and write the decoration settings held in hypr/hyprland/general.lua.

The only code that knows how those settings are spelled in Lua. The settings
page, the snapshot a saved theme keeps, and the restore an apply performs all
go through here, so none of them can drift from the others about what a key
means or where it lives.

    decorations.py read     <general.lua> [--flag-dir DIR]
    decorations.py defaults <general.lua>
    decorations.py shipped  <general.lua>
    decorations.py write    <general.lua> <values.json> [--flag-dir DIR]
    decorations.py restore  <general.lua> <values.json> [--flag-dir DIR] [--push]
    decorations.py set      <general.lua> key=value ... [--flag-dir DIR]
    decorations.py push     <values.json> [--no-reload]

Where a setting lives is derived from its hyprctl keyword rather than stated
twice: decoration:blur:size is the field `size`, inside `blur`, inside
`decoration`. Blocks are found by matching braces rather than by scanning to
the next `}` -- general holds col and snap, decoration holds blur and shadow,
and shadow holds an offset pair, so a field can sit after a nested block has
closed and a scan would stop short of it.

write() only touches keys the values file actually carries — the settings
page speaks one key at a time. restore() is what a theme apply uses instead:
it fills every key the snapshot doesn't name from the schema defaults, because
a setting absent from a snapshot did not exist when the theme was saved, and
stock is what the machine showed then. Leaving those keys alone instead meant
applying an older theme kept whatever the previous theme had put in the newer
keys, and the older theme no longer looked like its save. Snapshots from
before two keys were renamed still say borders / roundCorners; a false there
restores as its modern spelling's zero, and a true is the default the
completion supplies anyway. restore --push also sends that completed set to
the compositor, so a theme apply spends one interpreter rather than two.
